// why Flutter ?
// Architecture: Flutter uses a native rendering engine, while React Native 
//               uses a JavaScript bridge to interact with native components.

// Animation Performance: Flutter offers smoother animations through Skia, 
//                        while React Native may face performance issues 
//                        with complex animations due to the JavaScript bridge.

// Startup Time:  Flutter's  ARM code ahead of time (AOT) compilation leads to faster startup, 
//                whereas React Native may have slower startup due 
//                to JavaScript initialization.

// Memory Usage: Flutter apps tend to use more memory, while React Native is often
//               more resource-efficient with native components.

// CPU and GPU Usage: Flutter optimizes CPU and GPU performance for intensive graphics,
//                    while React Native may struggle with GPU-heavy tasks.

// Handling Complex Features: Flutter handles complex features more efficiently, 
//                           while React Native may require native code for optimal performance.




// Note:  1. UI elements and functionalities provided by the operating system of the device (iOS or Android).
//        2. ARM code ahead of time (AOT) refers to the process in which Flutter compiles its Dart code 
//          directly into native machine code (ARM or x86) for the target device before the app is run. 
//          This is done ahead of time, meaning the code is compiled during the build process, not at runtime.
